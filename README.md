# CustomEnchants

This was my first real project freelancing and helped me learn a lot, though I still had a while to go.

*(the server shut down before it was finished & I never got paid - otherwise I wouldn't of made this public)*

A lot of the code here is still a mess, `pw.xwy.customenchants.listeners.EnchantDrop` for example

A lot of the commit messages are also useless because I never intended to make this project public

A lot of the code is currently a mess, but I'm in the progress of updating it and migrating it to Kotlin (cause going between two similar languages in one project is a little much for me)

I'm not sure if the Maven needs anything to be launched on another computer, I haven't noticed anything
