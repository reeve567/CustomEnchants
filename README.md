# CustomEnchants

This was my first real project freelancing and helped me learn a lot, though I still had a while to go.

A lot of the code is currently a mess, but I'm in the progress of updating it and migrating it to Kotlin (cause going between two similar languages in one project is a little much for me)

I'm not sure if the Maven needs anything to be launched on another computer, I haven't noticed anything
